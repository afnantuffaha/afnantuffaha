## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a computer science student at Northeastern University with a concentration in **software** and a minor in **mathematics**. I enjoy designing scalable backend systems, building clean user interfaces, and applying problem-solving to create impactful tools. My work spans across both **frontend and backend development**, with a strong focus on building thoughtful, maintainable software.  

Outside of code, you'll likely find me singing, playing with my pet bunny, or drinking way too much Pepsi.
